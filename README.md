## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

Before I take on  any challenge I am a little itimidated but now as I a take on more challenges I am getting more confident. I should say my confidence in CSS is increasing.

### Continued development

I want to focuse more on responsive web desigining.
